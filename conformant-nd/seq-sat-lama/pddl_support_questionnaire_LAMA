= PDDL support questionnaire =

In your planner submission email, please attach or include answers to the following questions. One convenient way of doing this is by clicking on the following link to obtain a [[PddlSupportQuestionnaire|plain text version of this page|&action=raw]], and then cutting and pasting from there. Edit the parts [in brackets] to give your answers, and leave everything else as is.

 * If you submit several planners or planner versions, please fill in one copy of the questionnaire for each. If they are mostly identical, just copy-and-paste.
 * You only need to fill in the questionnaire once per planner, not once per track. If your answers are different for the different tracks, please indicate. For example, your planner might support conditional effects only in the sequential tracks, but not in the temporal tracks.

== General questions ==

 * Name of planner: LAMA
 * Names of team members: Silvia Richter, Matthias Westphal
 
== Tracks ==

The planner is entered in the following '''tracks''' (please remove all options that don't apply; multiple answers possible):
 * [The planner is entered in the sequential satisficing track.]

== Features ==

The planner supports '''object fluents''' in the following way (please remove all options apart from the one that applies):
 * [The planner only supports predicate representations, no object fluent representations.]
 
The planner supports '''PDDL types''' in the following way (please remove all options apart from the one that applies):
 * [The planner supports both representations, and there is no preference for either.]

The planner supports '''grounded representations''' in the following way (please remove all options apart from the one that applies):
 * [The planner supports both representations, and representations with schematic operators are preferred.]

The planner supports the following '''optional features''' (please remove all options that don't apply; multiple answers possible):
 * [The planner supports negative preconditions in STRIPS operators and in the goal specification.]
 * [The planner supports general ADL conditions ({{{exists}}}, {{{forall}}}, {{{or}}}, ...) in operators and goals.]
 * [The planner supports conditional effects ({{{when}}}) in operators.]
 * [The planner supports universal effects ({{{forall}}}) in operators.]
 * [The planner supports derived predicates.]

The planner supports '''numeric state variables''' in the following way (please remove the one that doesn't apply):
 * [Numeric state variables are not supported.]

Note that support for numeric state variables (beyond support of action costs) is not needed in the sequential tracks, and that numeric state variables are ''required'' in the temporal and net benefit tracks. However, we expect some planners that don't support numeric state variables to be entered in the temporal and net benefit tracks. (These planners will then score zero points in domains where numbers are necessary.)

The planner supports '''temporal planning''' in the following way (please remove all options apart from the one that applies):
 * [Temporal planning is not supported.]

Note that support for durative actions is not needed in the sequential tracks, and of course it is required in the temporal tracks. Durative actions are an optional feature in the net benefit tracks.
